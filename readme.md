#Anamorpher

Anamorpher is a Processing-based program that allows you to easily anamorph your images using a cylinder projection. 

##Installation:
I provide the source .pde file that Processing calls a "sketch". Be sure to include the Data/ folder provided in your sketch's home directory. This is where the program sources all of its assets

I also provide compiled versions of the program for Linux and Windows. Processing does not support exporting to MacOS from any platform but MacOS, so please keep this in mind if you try to export yourself. You can find out more about exporting a Processing application (here)[https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Export-Info-and-Tips].


##Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Professor Brecher at Boston University who gave me guidance and advised me in the creation of this program. Many more can be found at (dichopter.com)[dichopter.com], where I had the opportunity to make web apps that explore the wonders of dichoptic vision!
